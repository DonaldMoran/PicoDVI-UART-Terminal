Here are some ideas to extend your terminal project:

Add Scrollback Buffer
Allow users to scroll up and view previous output, not just what's visible on the screen.

Implement Copy/Paste Support
Add keyboard shortcuts or I2C commands for copying and pasting text.

Support for More ANSI Escape Sequences
Extend your ANSI parser to handle more codes (e.g., text attributes like bold, underline, blink).

User-Configurable Key Bindings
Let users remap control keys for menus and actions.

Customizable Font or Font Size
Allow switching between different bitmap fonts or font sizes.

File Transfer/Upload Support
Implement a simple protocol to send/receive files over I2C or another interface.

Status Bar or On-Screen Indicators
Show current mode, cursor style, or active theme at the bottom/top of the screen.

Scripting or Macro Support
Allow users to record and replay sequences of commands.

Mouse Input Emulation
Add support for mouse events (if hardware allows), or emulate mouse actions via keyboard.

Network Connectivity
Add a Wi-Fi or Ethernet module for remote terminal access or telnet/SSH support.
