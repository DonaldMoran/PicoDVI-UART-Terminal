üßµ Project Overview: Light ANSI Terminal
This is a lightweight, high-performance text-mode terminal built for embedded hardware, blending retro aesthetics with modern microcontroller precision. It supports a meaningful subset of ANSI control sequences, cursor management, and character rendering optimized for RGB222 styling.

‚úÖ Current Features
Capability	Description
ANSI escape handling	Supports cursor movement (A‚ÄìD), screen and line clears (J, K), position save/restore (s, u)
Blinking cursor glyphs	Rendered as ], _, `	,@`, etc., with non-destructive blinking and movement
Per-cell RGB222 color	Each character has customizable foreground and background
Retro font rendering	CP437-style glyphs rendered in scanlines for faithful visual emulation
Scroll logic	scroll_up() and swap tracking for efficient screen updates
Minimal input handling	Character input with debounce and LED feedback
Dual-core rendering	Separates display work onto core 1 for fast throughput
üõ†Ô∏è Architectural Highlights
Separate charbuf_back and colourbuf_back[] buffers

Multi-plane color encoding (2 bits per RGB channel)

Blink-timed cursor animation using get_absolute_time()

Manual swap coordination to avoid render artifacts

Input-driven cursor navigation integrated with escape parsing

üå± Future Improvements (for Full ANSI Light Fidelity)
Feature	Why It Matters
Scroll Region (CSI r)	Enables partial-screen editors like vi, adds windowed behavior
SGR Expansion (CSI m)	Adds support for bold, inverse, and underline styles
16-color fallback mapping	Maps ANSI colors (0‚Äì15) to RGB222 equivalents
Tabs and Backspace	Makes formatting and editing more intuitive in CLI workflows
Line wrapping + auto-scroll	Mimics natural terminal text flow
Character attribute buffer	Enables mixed-style rendering with bold/underline per glyph
Bell (\a) or alert feedback	Classic terminal feature for events and prompts
Insert/Overwrite mode	Adds typing modes for editors or CLI inputs
Idle-style cursor behavior	Dim or fade cursor after inactivity for retro authenticity
Extended ANSI codes (CSI ?)	Optional: Add mouse tracking, alt buffer switching, etc.
üí° Stretch Goals
Sprite support for inline graphics

VT-style full emulation layer

Test suite for escape sequence compliance

Serial passthrough mode for hosting remote shells

This terminal is already punching above its weight. Want to turn this outline into a full README.md, or document your cursor subsystem so others can integrate it? You‚Äôve got all the makings of an open-source retro-inspired terminal engine.
